## The Starfish Wasting Disease and how FHL Scientists are working to cure it

For the next 4 weeks I will be at the Salish Sea Sciences summer camp and I'll be at Friday Harbor Labs (FHL) a lot more, but we were able to visit today and meet some of the scientists working there. I was especially fascinated by the massive Sunflower starfish they had there, in huge tanks that had flowing water directly from the Salish Sea. We learned a lot about Wasting Disease, an illness that causes Starfish to rapidly decline in health, generate lesions on their surface, lose limbs that are still walking around and in extreme cases, to leak organs from their missing arm-holes. It literally causes them to waste away before you.

 "Wasting Disease in an Ochre Star")

 Wasting disease affects all Starfish, but not equally- Sunflower Stars are made up of a disproportionately large amount of soft tissue and, as such, are disproportionately affected by Wasting Disease (WD). WD is an extremely contagious waterborne disease that travels at alarming rates and has wiped out starfish populations from Southern California all the way to the San Juans. It is incredibly destructive, incredibly fast and incredibly contagious. Many scientists are worried that it may result in the end of all starfish if the problem isn't dealt with effectively and rapidly.

 Researchers in the FHL on San Juan Island are working hard day and night, keeping nearly 30 Sunflower Stars in tanks and working in collaboration with neighboring marine disease facilities, sending them samples both live and dead for research purposes. Now, because the stars are out of contagious water, keeping them safe from WD should be trivially easy, right? Unfortunately, no. FHL Researchers keep a running flow of water directly from the Salish Sea pumping into each sea tank, making sure that waste, temperature, PH and salinity are all taken care of. It also makes rehabilitation for stars much simpler, as they live in the same water as what's in the wild. However, this also adds the risk of WD getting into the pipes and contaminating the water that runs through. Luckily, it's a flowing water source, meaning that the WD is taken out of the tank as quickly as it's put in. However, this doesn't mean there's no risk of WD. Over the past year, around 15 odd stars have contracted or died of WD, and most have been in the same tank as each other when they caught it.

 This leads me to my main point. Because there's always a present risk of WD in sheltered tanks, researchers have to be incredibly safe about quarantine- this doesn't always mean there won't be enough time for WD to spread. Special Star #1 was actually the survivor of a particularly frightening outbreak. Her name is Fanta, and she was in the same tank as a star dying of WD for around 24 hours before researchers found out and moved her. She exhibited no signs of having contracted WD despite her long period of exposure. This indicates a potential resilience in either her immune system or genes, but because she hasn't spawned since then, researchers have no way to confirm nor deny a mutational resilience to WD. 
 
 Our Second Special Star has an even more impressive story. Her name is Sunna, and she was the sole survivor of a tank of 6 stars dying of Wasting. She was put in quarantine for a period of time, but even during that period she showed no symptoms of wasting and has continued growing despite losing her siblings to the disease. She is now 3 years old and spawned millions of eggs for the first time earlier this year. FHL Researchers were only able to keep about 12,000- the rest were automatically blown out into the sea through the FHL's filtration system. That number has now thinned to about 120 later in the year, thanks to cannibalism and deformities that stop larvae from getting the nutrients they need. 

 Things are not looking good for the lab, however, as last year they were only able to squeeze out 75 surviving larva from a mother. Researchers are hoping for a higher number this year, but for now, a little hope and a lucky star (See what I did there?) might be able to tell these researchers if Sunna will be the progenitor of a new Sea Star species that are resistant to the Wasting Disease.
